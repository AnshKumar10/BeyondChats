## Technologies Used

- React (TypeScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui

## Highlights

- **Responsive design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile screens.
- **Lucide Icons**: Used visually similar alternatives from the Lucide library where exact matches weren’t available.
- **Gradient Colors**: I wasn’t able to find the exact colors used in the video reference, so I used similar shades to closely match the original gradient.
- **Smooth UX**: Integrated animations with Framer Motion and `tailwindcss-animate` for enhanced experience.
- **Clean Code**: Written using TypeScript and ESLint for better structure and maintainability.

Thank you for reviewing my submission. I look forward to your feedback!
